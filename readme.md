# Carta Healthcare. Home Assignment

It was a great experience attending the assessment `Carta Healthcare` provided.

I've spent totally 45 mins on the entire steps for this assessment, including specification, coding, and documentation.

```
* Specification - 10 mins
* Coding - 30 mins (BasicReactScaffold - 23 mins, TravelingKnight - 7 mins)
* Documentation - about 5 mins
```

Each task folder has `README.md` so that you can follow the instructions for testing. And I provided some explanation for the solutions.

Thanks & Regards
